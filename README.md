# SwipeSaver

## What is it?
Swipesaver is a user-friendly website for RPI students to see what every dining hall is serving that day, so students are able to decide if they want to use or save their meal swipe, as well as see what other students think about the meal. Users can rate a meal station 1-5 stars once they've tried the food and the average rating across all students is displayed.

## How does it work
Our web app scrapes information off of RPI's food vendor website (Sodexo) using Beautiful Soup and Django Python to cleanly display and organize meals, as well as allow them to be rated.
